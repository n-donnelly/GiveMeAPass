Android App to Generate Unique Passwords for different services.
It tackles the current problem of people using the same password for everything. 
This app aims to allow users to create unique passwords for each passwords that are completely and securely reproducable whenever needed.

Users have a single pass phrase that is hashed and stored on the phone.

The user can then add different services for which they need passwords. 
Once a service is added, the user can use their usual password to generate a new unique password for the service.

This new password can be exactly regenerated ever time using the app once the same password is entered.
